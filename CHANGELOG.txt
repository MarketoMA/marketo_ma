------------------------------
- #2053673: Handle submission structure changes made in Webform 4.x
- #2062165: Added CHANGELOG.txt
- #2062181: Create rule action to retrieve lead data from Marketo
  Rule action "Add data to Marketo lead" has been changed
  to "Send lead data to Marketo" and underlying function has changed name
  from "add_lead" to "marketo_ma_rules_action_add_lead".
- #2066465: Added basic drush support
- #2068255: Added keyType auto-detection when querying Marketo for lead data.
  Function "_marketo_ma_get_lead" renamed to "marketo_ma_get_lead", it is safe
  to call this function directly.
- #2067857: Variable marketo_ma_webform_fields_soap is now deleted upon uninstall
- #2067861: Added ability to view lead and activity information for a given user
- #2123391: Modified marketo_ma_add_lead function to pass marketoCookie param
  _mkto_trk cookie value will now be sent to Marketo when using either of the
  SOAP methods and the request to save the lead was made by either an anonymous
  visitor or by the lead updating their own data.
- #2126019: Added settings for including or excluding tracking based on user role
- Reorganized admin settings form to use vertical tabs and display more
  information related to webform configuration.
- #2123395: Added default rules which can be used as examples or extended to do
  something more useful, perhaps adding more data to the list of values being
  sent. If using the marketo_ma_user module these three rules should not be used
  as they duplicate functionality already in place.
- #2126709: The marketo_ma_user module now allows for mapping user fields to
  Marketo fields and defining which events should trigger updates.
